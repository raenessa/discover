# mcmcnail (this is a pun)
# This project was conducted under the LSU Discover Grant for the 2022-2023 academic year, with Dr. Matthew Penny as research advisor.

hello! welcome to my project, where i use the emcee package to analyze archival KMTNet data. the important file in this section is "mcmcnail.py", which has some comments to lead you through the code and let you know what is being manipulated, on your system or within the notebook. the second most important files are the eventfiles, mcmcfigs, mcmchains, and mcmcorners folders, and the "alertdates.csv" file. that is all you should theoretically NEED to get mcmcnail working, but there are plenty of other files you can look through to see all the different components that led to the script. 

unfortunately, this script started giving me trouble in the last couple weeks of my research period, and i leave all its flaws and issues to the next soul who dare pick up the predictive modeling project. immortalized in time is the "mcmc.ipynb" notebook, which is the last time it officially worked without a problem and also what i used for presentations, so feel free to look at the notebook. 

hopefully, this gives you enough background to piece together what was going through my head when i wrote all this code. however, if it isn't enough, please feel free to email me! i can't promise how much i'll be able to help, but i will always be excited to hear from anyone picking up this project!

wishing health and safety,

p.s. the creator of the emcee package calls it the MCMC hammer, so i felt it fitting to call my script a nail, as it predicts the length of an event and hence nails down its guesses.
